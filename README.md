## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I studied some CSS FlexBox techniques to align items:

```css
.rating.left {
align-self: flex-start;}

.rating.right {
align-self: flex-end;}
```

The challenge's design has a lot of details and items, so I had to put some @media-queries to adjust items on screen 1024px, 768px, 425px and 320px. 


### Useful resources

- [B7 Web](https://www.b7web.com.br) - B7Web is an online web developer course from Brazil. So i learned how to write HTML and CSS codes studying B7Web's classes.
